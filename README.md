## Description

This is a Node.js application that allows users to check the backend functioning of a potential social media platform using a NoSQL database. The models include a user model as well as models for 'reactions' and 'thoughts'. This application allows for the creation and deletion of users, posting, editing, and deleting of posts or 'thoughts' and reactions to those thoughts. There are also routes to add or delete users as friends.
